    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>A native of Charlotte, NC, I attended Duke University, graduated in 2010 with a B.S. in Biology with a chem minor. After graduating, I worked at the Duke Reading Center, where I interpreted Optical Coherence Tomograpy images and managed large medical databases. In 2013, I received an M.S. in Physiology from Georgetown University. After working as a math and science tutor, I became a surgical technologist at a small urology practice, where I worked until 2018.</p>

    <p>Seeking a field utilizing creative problem solving and critical thinking skills, I enrolled in the George Washington University web development bootcamp. I am excited to begin creating my own webpages and web applications. By the end of the course, I will be proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript and node.js.</p>
